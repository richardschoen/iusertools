## Overview
Open source packages, utilities and languages including Python, Node, Java, PHP and more have been available for several years on IBM i via PASE and QShell.    

Developers are developing new apps using open-source languages in PASE and QShell but not often not enabling them to be easily utilized with standard classic jobs streams and apps written using CL, RPG and COBOL. 

Imagine if you could couple the power and speed of open-source on iBM i with your classic development to give your classic teams new super powers. Your toolbox of useful CL commands and APIs on IBM i would expand exponentially.    

```iUserTools``` is a great way to integrate all your traditional IBM i programs and processes with both internal classic apps, QShell or PASE apps. These apps can also easily integrate with the outside world to consume data from external applications and services. All from the comfort of RPG, CL and COBOL.     

And your annual subscription ```helps your IBM i team stay current on all the new open source integration tech``` without the painful learning curve. Your apps can integrate on your IBM i and externally via the web.
